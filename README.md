# LightComputationReflectedWeightofLightForce
A computation of simulation of the light computation of inetially built up reflected to build transformative energetic light motion in density in reoccuring enviroments. The idea is to create a pressurized volume of mass of lights weightless motion of speed and close it into a thrust enviromental everchanging thrust of dynamic Weight of Light Force
